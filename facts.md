3. 96.43% (703 out of 729) of nobel laureates in the Sciences are male.<sup>[NUMBER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_female_Nobel_laureates)</sup>
4. 97.99% (2002 out of 2043) of chess grandmasters are male, and 96.97% (642 out of 662) of grandmaster titles since 2010 were awarded to men.<sup>[NUMBER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chess_grandmasters)</sup>

## Heredity
